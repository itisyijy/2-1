1) I have shown that the binomial distribution approaches the poission distribution 
when n is large and p is small.

It will help to your understanding.
But you may skip the proof in the recording 15:58 - 20:00 in chapter 3 lecture part 4.

2) I have shown that the sum of two independent poisson random variables 
follows poisson distribution.

It will help to your understanding.
But you may skip the proof in the recording 28:12 - 32:08 in chapter 3 lecture part 4.

3) I have also shown that the sum of two independent poisson random variables 
follows poisson distribution by using the moment generating function.

It will help to your understanding.
But you may skip the proof in the recording 2:17 - 32:08 in chapter 3 lecture part 5.

In chapter 3 lecture part 5,
  - I introduced the moment generating function of probability distributions.
  - Mean and variance of poisson distribution are derived by using moment generating function.
  - The sum of two independent poisson random variables follows poisson distribution 
     by using the moment generating function.

4) In chapter 3 lecture part 6, 
  - I have refered a site that derives the poisson process. 
    But you may skip the recording 3:16 - 5:40 in chapter 3 lecture part 6.
  - I have shown another derivation of the poisson process.
    But you may skip the recording 15:06 - 19:05 in chapter 3 lecture part 6.
